Week 1 Assignment: Build a Cryptocurrency Advisor Chatbot
Theme: "Your First AI-Powered Financial Sidekick!" 🌟

Objective

Create a rule-based chatbot that analyzes cryptocurrency data and provides investment advice based on profitability (e.g., price trends) and sustainability (e.g., energy efficiency, project viability).

What You’ll Learn

✅ Basics of AI-driven decision-making.
✅ How to design conversational logic.
✅ Simple data analysis for crypto trends.

Tools & Resources

Language: Python (beginner-friendly).

Libraries: Use if-else logic or ChatterBot (optional) for conversation flow.

Data: Predefined crypto datasets (provided below).

Platform: Code in Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any IDE.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Design the Chatbot’s Personality

Name your bot (e.g., CryptoBuddy).

Define its tone: Friendly, professional, or meme-loving? (e.g., “Hey there! Let’s find you a green and growing crypto!”).

2. Predefined Crypto Data

Use this sample dataset (or create your own):

python

crypto_db = {  
    "Bitcoin": {  
        "price_trend": "rising",  
        "market_cap": "high",  
        "energy_use": "high",  
        "sustainability_score": 3/10  
    },  
    "Ethereum": {  
        "price_trend": "stable",  
        "market_cap": "high",  
        "energy_use": "medium",  
        "sustainability_score": 6/10  
    },  
    "Cardano": {  
        "price_trend": "rising",  
        "market_cap": "medium",  
        "energy_use": "low",  
        "sustainability_score": 8/10  
    }  
}  
3. Chatbot Logic

User Inputs: Ask questions like:

“Which crypto is trending up?”

“What’s the most sustainable coin?”

Bot Responses:

Use if-else logic to match queries to data.

Example:

python
if "sustainable" in user_query:  
    recommend = max(crypto_db, key=lambda x: crypto_db[x]["sustainability_score"])  
    print(f"Invest in {recommend}! 🌱 It’s eco-friendly and has long-term potential!")  
4. Add Advice Rules

Profitability: Prioritize coins with price_trend = "rising" and market_cap = "high".

Sustainability: Prioritize coins with energy_use = "low" and sustainability_score > 7/10.

5. Test Your Bot

Sample conversation:


You: Which crypto should I buy for long-term growth?  
CryptoBuddy: Cardano (ADA) is trending up and has a top-tier sustainability score! 🚀  
Stretch Goals (Optional)

API Integration: Pull real-time data using CoinGecko’s free API.

NLP: Use NLTK to handle more natural language queries.

Ethics Alert: Add a disclaimer like “Crypto is risky—always do your own research!”

Submission

Share your GitHub repo (include Intro Readme,  screenshots  of the chatbot and .py files) to finish the assignment.

Screen record yourself interacting with the chatbot for 30 seconds and share on the PLP Academy Community on the LMS.

Write a 50-word summary: “How does this chatbot mimic basic AI decision-making?”. Share this plus a screenshot with your peer group on the Groups tab of the LMS.
